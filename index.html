            <p class="sectionTag text-big">Mouse</p>
            <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">A computer mouse (plural mice, sometimes mouses)[nb 1] is a hand-held
                pointing device that detects two-dimensional motion relative to a surface. This motion is typically
                translated into the motion of a pointer on a display, which allows a smooth control of the graphical
                user interface of a computer.

                The first public demonstration of a mouse controlling a computer system was in 1968. Mice originally
                used two separate wheels to track movement across a surface: one in the X-dimension and one in the Y.
                Later, the standard design shifted to utilize a ball rolling on a surface to detect motion. Most modern
                mice use optical sensors that have no moving parts. Though originally all mice were connected to a
                computer by a cable, many modern mice are cordless, relying on short-range radio communication with the
                connected system.

                In addition to moving a cursor, computer mice have one or more buttons to allow operations such as the
                selection of a menu item on a display. Mice often also feature other elements, such as touch surfaces
                and scroll wheels, which enable additional control and dimensional input.

            <p class="sectionTag text-big">Keyboard</p>
            <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">A computer keyboard is an input device that allows a person to enter
                letters, numbers, and other symbols (together, these are called characters) into a computer. It is one
                of the most used input devices for computers. Using a keyboard is often called typing.

                A keyboard contains many mechanical switches or push-buttons called "keys". When one of these are
                pushed, an electrical circuit is closed, and the keyboard sends a signal to the computer that tells it
                what letter, number or symbol it would like to be shown on the screen. The computer then shows the
                character on the screen, usually at the place where the flashing text cursor is.

                Besides entering characters, computer keyboards also have special keys that change the symbol (such as
                shift or caps lock) or give the computer special commands (such as the arrow keys, CTRL and ALT).
                Different computer operating systems use different special keys, or use them differently. Special
                commands can also be activated through combinations of keys, called keyboard shortcuts. Some of the most
                common shortcuts on Windows programs are: Ctrl + C, to copy some text or a picture; Ctrl + V, to paste
                what was copied; and Ctrl + F, to find a certain word on a document or web page.

                A keyboard can be joined to a computer using a wire, but can also be wireless (like those that use
                Bluetooth). Most wired 21st century keyboards connect to a USB socket on the computer, but older ones
                use a round, purple DIN connector.

            <p class="sectionTag text-big">Joystick</p>
            <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">A joystick, sometimes called a flight stick, is an input device
                consisting of a stick that pivots on a base and reports its angle or direction to the device it is
                controlling. A joystick, also known as the control column, is the principal control device in the
                cockpit of many civilian and military aircraft, either as a centre stick or side-stick. It often has
                supplementary switches to control various aspects of the aircraft's flight.

                Joysticks are often used to control video games, and usually have one or more push-buttons whose state
                can also be read by the computer. A popular variation of the joystick used on modern video game consoles
                is the analog stick. Joysticks are also used for controlling machines such as cranes, trucks, underwater
                unmanned vehicles, wheelchairs, surveillance cameras, and zero turning radius lawn mowers. Miniature
                finger-operated joysticks have been adopted as input devices for smaller electronic equipment such as
                mobile phones.

            <p class="sectionTag text-big">Microphone</p>
            <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">A microphone, colloquially called a mic or mike (/maÉªk/),[1] is a
                transducer that converts sound into an electrical signal. Microphones are used in many applications such
                as telephones, hearing aids, public address systems for concert halls and public events, motion picture
                production, live and recorded audio engineering, sound recording, two-way radios, megaphones, and radio
                and television broadcasting. They are also used in computers for recording voice, speech recognition,
                VoIP, and for other purposes such as ultrasonic sensors or knock sensors.

                Several types of microphone are used today, which employ different methods to convert the air pressure
                variations of a sound wave to an electrical signal. The most common are the dynamic microphone, which
                uses a coil of wire suspended in a magnetic field; the condenser microphone, which uses the vibrating
                diaphragm as a capacitor plate; and the contact microphone, which uses a crystal of piezoelectric
                material. Microphones typically need to be connected to a preamplifier before the signal can be recorded
                or reproduced.
